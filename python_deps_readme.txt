before installing the dependencies for robopoint I made sure to backup the dependencies for what was previously on the system.

i then installed the new dependenices of robopoint library in reqs.txt using 
pip install --user -r reqs.txt

hopefully this is reversible :)

installation happened without failure but it uninstalled some dependencies...
